# DogModel
This project uses pre-trained CNN models (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG) to classify user-uploaded images, comparing model performance. It processes animal and object images, outputs results in logs, and demonstrates transfer learning's power. Ideal for learning and experimentation, with future plans for fine-tuning and extended model support.
